            With a master's degree and a minor in business administration,
            I possess strong digital and analytical skills as well as core understanding of business.

            to a comprehensive business context and finally to project success.
            My main coursework includes machine learning and software engineering with additional modules in economics and entrepreneurship.
            Through hands-on assignments, I gained practical experience in Python, using these techniques to solve real-world problems in data analytics and natural language processing.
            During my university years, I had the opportunity to engage in group projects where I not only acquired valuable collaboration abilities but also took the initiative to demonstrate leadership and further refine my problem-solving abilities.
            <br><br>
            My academic knowledge is complemented by extensive hands-on experience in Software Development and Data Science, gained over several years as a working student.

            At a previous employer, I played a key role in propelling a project forward by communicating with the client
            and specifying the solution, resulting in timely delivery of a data transformation solution that reduced errors saved the client 32 hours of manual work per month.
            Professionally and at university I have worked on data intensive projects using Python and relevant libraries such as Pandas, Kedro and Apache Spark.
            At work, I prioritize open communication and commitment to perfection to deliver high-quality solutions that exceed project requirements and foster a positive working environment.
            <br><br>
            I'm an ambitious and goal-oriented individual with an entrepreneurial drive to build, and a creative mindset that strives for stretch goals.
